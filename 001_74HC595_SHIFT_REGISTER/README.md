# 001_74HC595_SHIFT_REGISTER

In this example I use 74HC595 shift register to control 8 led diodes. You can also connect more shift registers in series to control more leds. Only 5 GPIO pins are required no matter how many shift registers you want to control. I use a Arduino Nano board as development board. The clones are really cheap and they have everything you need.
